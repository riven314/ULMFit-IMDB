       "  xxmaj there 's no real skin here -- xxmaj ayers just strips down xxup slowly to her underwear ( twice ) . xxmaj the rest is just a boring little tale chockful of bad acting , atrocious \" comedy \" ( never thought prostitution was funny but what do i know ? ) and terrible post - dubbed dialogue . i admit there was a twist at the end i did n't see coming but that 's not enough to sit through this . xxmaj also xxmaj ayers ' attempts at acting are hysterical ! a real bomb . xxmaj avoid .,xxbos xxmaj dennis xxmaj hopper is without a doubt one of the finest underrated xxmaj american actors of our time , and it was interesting to see how he would play out his role as a cop on the case of a child serial killer . xxmaj most movies xxmaj hopper has always played to psychotic menace threatening to blow up stuff or go on a killing spree , but in this movie , xxmaj hopper tried his best to keep that intensity and emotion while carrying a shield . xxmaj once i got into the plot of the movie , i was hooked , but it 's just the little things that ultimately murdered the film . \n",

       "  xxmaj the concept of the film is great - not only are the cops on the move of catching the killer , but we get a chance to see how the gangsters operate in catching the killer . xxmaj the subplot of the football stadium is kinda ridiculous , but necessary to involve the gangsters in the killer hunt . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj that 's about all that is good you can say about the film . xxmaj although xxmaj hopper did try to act like a tough , experienced street smart cop , i ca n't help but feel his acting was below par , and there was n't enough conviction that he was truly attached to the case . xxmaj the directing was also terrible - it did n't have the feel of a true film , but rather a xxup tv - movie production . xxmaj this is most evident when the gangsters meet for the first time to form an elite team to hunt the killer down . xxmaj when the leading gangster shoots the other mouthy gangster in slow motion , the acting was weak , predictable and terribly unexciting . xxmaj that 's when i knew that 1st of all , the action is going to be atrocious . \n",

       "  xxmaj the xxunk of the camera was amateurish , and the recalling scenes or haunting images of the killer 's little sister had no true distinctive effect . xxmaj if it was supposed to be scary , it was n't . xxmaj everyone 's acting was terrible , and even for xxmaj hopper , i did n't feel for his character , and i just did n't really care too much about his relationship with his daughter . \n",

       "  xxmaj the final thing that bothered me the most is the swat team . xxmaj once i saw the swat team in action , i was thinking , finally , something good . xxmaj but i was wrong . 1st of all , the entire swat team consisted of 4 guys . xxmaj that is just impossible . 2nd of all , apparently the swat team has no training whatsoever because many times in the film they carry their xxup xxunk submachine guns with one hand . xxmaj had the killer been hiding near the staircase with a shotgun , these 4 idiots would 've been blown to bits because they were n't even aiming at anything or paying close attention . xxmaj they should have had both hands on the gun aiming forward , but it just looks like they 're not taking the job seriously and are just flaunting around . 3rd , xxup swat team members do not yell out commands such as \" xxmaj keep your eyes open , watch out for yourselves , are we good to go ... etc . \" xxmaj in reality , they use hand signals or have radios . xxmaj but they 're literally yelling at each other - how are you supposed to catch the killer when he can hear you 're coming ? ? ? xxmaj and to top it all off , these guys have no plan - apparently they 're just running up and down going on a wild turkey chase . xxmaj eventually they end up doing nothing . xxmaj that was the last straw . i 'm no expert on special forces , but basically what i 've just outlined , is pretty common sense . xxmaj when the audience knows the movie is terrible , the action pretty much becomes the life - saver of the movie - when you ca n't even make an effort to make the action great , the movie is lost . \n",

       "  i give 2 stars for the concept , but the rest can not be credited . xxmaj if you want to watch a crime thriller , do n't bother with this one . xxmaj there 's plenty of crime in the movie - but it has the lack of thrill .,xxbos xxmaj painful to watch , and not entirely for empathy with the struggles of the characters . xxmaj two of the main characters , xxmaj cynthia the mother and xxmaj monica the acknowledged daughter , spend the great bulk of the film pathetically mewling and bitterly bitching respectively . xxmaj their characters are so firmly established that their redemption into tolerable personalities after a quick family catharsis is unbelievable . xxmaj it was n't worth the wait . i wish a worthy pitch for honesty among families was less of a headache to view .,xxbos i already know that critics and some audiences say that it was a satire , there were numerous political and social messages , the names make refer to some other names etc . xxmaj it might be . i can not realize such things ( i do n't want to do anyway ) because i am not interested in , i am interested in ' cinema ' . xxmaj as for the movie itself , again it is said that the movie is clever and dramatically powerful . i could not see anything which we do n't see in monster movies except the scene which takes place in a office in the second half . xxmaj yes , that scene says somethings about humanity , but it does not make the movie brilliant . xxmaj the movie is entertaining ( mildly ) and exciting in some moments or scenes , but no more than that . xxmaj as for the biggest flaw of the movie , it is visual effects . xxmaj it was just shocking , i could not pull myself together for a while , because i had expected a realistic monster , because it is not one of the old xxmaj gojira movies , it was made in 2006 , but it was not . xxmaj it is like if you do n't believe that there is a monster , you can not care about . xxmaj if you agree with me about this , i highly recommend you xxmaj cloverfield that is extremely realistic . xxmaj the design of the monster is not interesting , but at least planned , there is an effort . xxmaj dramatically powerful critique . xxmaj some critics talk about it as if it is a xxmaj kurosawa movie . xxmaj yes , it is rather a drama than a thriller or action , but it should not mean that it is dramatically powerful . i do n't want to compare xxmaj the xxmaj host with other monster movies , but i try to mean that xxmaj the xxmaj host does not do something that other monster movies do not do . xxmaj by the way , may be some people call the movie masterpiece because of their sympathy for xxmaj asian cinema . xxmaj yes , i like xxmaj asian cinema too , but this is the fact .,xxbos xxmaj one of the worst romantic comedies ( nay , worst movies ) i 've ever seen . xxmaj boy ( who works as a phone psychic ! ) must pretend to be gay to move into apartment with woman of his dreams . xxmaj hilarity does not ensue . xxmaj boredom , light gay - bashing , and horrible dialogue do . xxmaj if you read xxmaj brad xxmaj xxunk and like his crappy dialogue , you 'll like this movie . \n",
